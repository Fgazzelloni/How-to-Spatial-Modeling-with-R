In geostatistical models, sampled data are interpreted as the result of a random process.\n–\nSpatial modeling is an important instrument to guide decision-making dealing with risk-management in different areas, such as public health, econometrics, general ecology, as well as public transportation and real-estate.\n–\nAn important distinction has to be made between spatial model and spatial data model. While data models are important connections between the individual perception of certain events and how those events are being represented and processed with an algorithm, for example as spatial primitives and relationships.\n–\nSpatial models are defined as process models. Dynamic spatial processes are phenomena that change in time, such as a virus spread, flood formation, and land cover change. A heuristic explanation of how point distances are calculated is to considered wheather the Eulerian or the Lagrangian views are the most suitable ones.\n–\n\n“Eulerian models concern about the change of properties (e.g. temperature, land cover) at fixed locations, while Lagrangian models tracks the movement of objects in space.”\n\n\nAs said, one more important distinction is that Geographic Information Systems (GISs) are composed of raster and vector data.\n–\n\nIn vector data models space is not quantized into discrete grid cells like the raster model, but use points and associated X, Y coordinate pairs to represent the vertices of spatial feature.\n\n–\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits: Spatial data models\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial models allows for spatial autocorrelation. In general modeling, multicollinearity, or correlation among predictors in the model is used to make predictors selection. In case of spatial modeling, predictors such as longitude and latitude are evidence of important underlying spatial processes at work; an integral component of the data.\n–\nSo, spatial data is considered typically autocorrelated and/or clustered. A simple explanation is related with the independency of correlated clusters with the changing data-information in the spatial cluster.\n–\nHence, data may be spatially correlated and observations in neighboring areas may be more similar than observations in areas that are farther away.\n–\nThe analysis of the residual spatial autocorrelation and the prediction of continuous spatial process is called Kriging (or, geo interpolation named after Danie Kringe (South Africa), also known as Wiener–Kolmogorov prediction / distance-weighted average).\n–\nA spatial model is a representation of various social and natural processes:\n\nland cover change\nspread of invasive species\npopulation migration\n\n\nSo, to be more explicit, spatial modeling combines spatial analysis and predictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits:https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.13116\n\n\n\n\n–\nKrinking is even the term that defines the best model performance, and so, the best prediction. This term is considered as synonym of prediction in classical data forecasting model techniques.\n\nThe integration of GIS and Multicriteria Decision-Making Analysis (MCDA) is key in providing help to decision makers in different areas. GIS-based MCDA use a linear weighted equation to combine the spatial variables.\n–\n\\[y=\\sum_{i=1}^n{w_if(x_i)}\\]\nWhere \\(W\\) defines a spatial neighborhood structure over the entire study region, and its elements can be viewed as weights.\nUnder this structure, the total number of neighbors in each area is adjusted to obtain a standardized matrix:\n\\[w_\\text{std(i,j)}=\\frac{w_{ij}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{w_{ij}}}\\]\n–\nThere are a number of spatial models that can be used, for Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Modelling, Prediction and Simulation. One is Kriging, while other methods are the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) or Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW).\n\n\nHands-on\n\nclass: chapter-slide\n\n\n\n\nSession 2\n\n\nIntroduction\n–\nThis example is from the {SpatialEpi} package, and it is about Lip cancer in Scotland area.\n–\nIn general, the first metric for disease risk estimation is the incidence, which is a measure of the probability of occurrence of a given medical condition in a population within a specified period of time. More specifically, the risk estimation can be obtained by computing the Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIRs).\n–\nThe ratio of the observed to the expected disease counts: \\[SIRi = \\frac{Y_i}{E_i}\\]\n–\n( the expected() function of the {SpatialEpi} package )\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(SpatialEpi)\ndata(\"scotland\")\nnames(scotland)\n\n[1] \"geo\"             \"data\"            \"spatial.polygon\" \"polygon\"        \n\n\n\n\n\n\nScotland Lip cancer data\n \n  \n    county.names \n    cases \n    expected \n    AFF \n  \n \n\n  \n    skye-lochalsh \n    9 \n    1.4 \n    0.16 \n  \n  \n    banff-buchan \n    39 \n    8.7 \n    0.16 \n  \n  \n    caithness \n    11 \n    3.0 \n    0.10 \n  \n  \n    berwickshire \n    9 \n    2.5 \n    0.24 \n  \n  \n    ross-cromarty \n    15 \n    4.3 \n    0.10 \n  \n  \n    orkney \n    8 \n    2.4 \n    0.24 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n–\nWe can plot the cases versus the expected and visualize them in one plot.\n\n\nmap <- fortify(scotland$spatial.polygon)\n\ncase_map <- ggplot(data=scotland$data,\n                    aes(map_id = county.names)) +\n  geom_map(map = map,aes(fill=cases)) +\n  expand_limits(x = map$long, y = map$lat) +\n  labs(title=\"Scotland cases\") +\n  ggthemes::theme_map()+\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") \n  \nexpected_map <- ggplot(data=scotland$data,\n            aes(map_id = county.names)) +\n  geom_map(map = map,aes(fill=expected)) +\n  expand_limits(x = map$long, y = map$lat) +\n  labs(title=\"Scotland expected\") +\n  ggthemes::theme_map() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\nAs well as adding some annotations.\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\ncase_map + expected_map +\n  plot_annotation(\n  title = \"Lip Cancer Spatial model -cases vs expected - Scotland\",\n  caption = \"Source: Scotland dataset in SpatialEpi_data\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel types:\n\nLR linear regression\nmultivariate logistic regression modeling of weights \\(w_i\\) (animal habitat)\ndiscriminant analysis (community resilience to environmental disasters)\nsupport vector machine (SVM)\ndecision-trees\ngenetic algorithm (GA)\nartificial neural network (ANN) or deep neural network (DNN)\n\n\nModel adjustment\nBase spatial models are adjusted to data-type based on the type of phenomenon that is investigated. As an example, a virus spread would be best represented with a Poisson distribution, of which a log transformation can be applied.\nA list of the tools for making models adjustment is to decide whether to use:\n\nCAR\nPoisson or spatial effect of the log of the Poisson\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nspatial cross validation resampling\ndeterministic or Bayesian model (Integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) is a computational less-intensive alternative to MCMC designed to perform approximate Bayesian inference in latent Gaussian models)\n\n\nFinally, validation is an important step in spatial modeling work. A model can be validated by testing its prediction in another dataset or study area that is different from the dataset or study area where the model was trained, allowing for spatial correlation and spatially correlated risk factors.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis is the end of our tutorial on how to spatial modeling with R.\nThe most interesting part of this overall introduction is how to manage different packages dealing with both raster and vector data. We now know how to deal with different type of data for making a map, and are aware of the model adjustments that are required for making a spatial model. Important to mention are the weights and the distances, these two factors are very important for influencing the results of a model predictor.\nGood luck with your maps!
