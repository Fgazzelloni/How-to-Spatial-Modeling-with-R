Another option is to use {usethis} and some of its handling functions, for open the project in your machine.\nOnce set go to the /data folder and load the RData in the environment. It will make things easier as you donâ€™t need to run some chucks of code which will require some time to compute, and for this reason are set to eval = FALSE.\nFor any questions please email: docksbox@pm.me"
