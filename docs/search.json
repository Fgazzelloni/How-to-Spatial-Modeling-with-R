    "text": "This ice-breaking activity to spatial modeling with R includes two case studies:\n\nOregon spotted frog habitat study\nA type of cancer spread in Scotland\n\nIt is required a good manner of RStudio and a little practice in making plots with {ggplot2}.\nTo set up install the following packages:\n\n\n\nIf these packages are missing in your RStudio they would need to be installed.\nPlease choose between {OpenStreetMap} and {ggmap}, {OpenStreetMap} has some extra Java requirement and it is not always available for the most updated versions of Mac.\n\nmy_packages <- c(\"tidyverse\",\"ggthemes\",\n                 \"maptools\",\"OpenStreetMap\",\"ggmap\",\n                 \"spdep\",\"sf\",\"spocc\",\n                 \"dismo\",\"SpatialEpi\")\n\ninstall.packages(my_packages, repos = \"http://cran.rstudio.com\")\n\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"fgazzelloni/oregonfrogs\")\n\nThe GitHub repository for this workshop is here: https://github.com/Fgazzelloni/How-to-Spatial-Modeling-with-R\nOnce installed the packages go to the GitHub repo above, You can fork the repository onto your RStudio, or copy and paste the code directly. Another option is to use {usethis} and some of its handling functions, for open the project in your machine.\nOnce set go to the /data folder and load the RData in the environment. It will make things easier as you don’t need to run some chucks of code which will require some time to compute, and for this reason are set to eval = false.\nFor any questions please email: docksbox@pm.me"

    "text": "This is the end of our tutorial on how to spatial modeling with R.\nThe most interesting part of this overall introduction is how to manage different packages dealing with both raster and vector data. We now know how to deal with different type of data for making a map, and are aware of the model adjustments that are required for making a spatial model. Important to mention are the weights and the distances, these two factors are very important for influencing the results of a model predictor.\nGood luck with your maps! I look forward to seeing your future Twitter posts for the next #30DayMapChallenge edition 2022."
