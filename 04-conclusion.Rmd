# Conclusion

This is the end of our tutorial on how to spatial modeling with R. 

The most interesting part of this overall introduction is how to manage different packages dealing with both raster and vector data. 
We now know how to deal with different type of data for making a map, and are aware of the model adjustments that are required for making a spatial model. Important to mention are the weights and the distances, these two factors are very important for influencing the results of a model predictor.

Good luck with your maps! I look forward to seeing your future Twitter posts for the next #30DayMapChallenge edition 2022 which starts on the first of October.
