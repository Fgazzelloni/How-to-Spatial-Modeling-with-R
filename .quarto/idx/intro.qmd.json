Dynamic spatial processes are phenomena that change in time, such as a virus spread, flood formation, and land cover change.\n\nA heuristic explanation of how point distances are calculated is to considered whether the Eulerian or the Lagrangian views are the most suitable ones.\n\n> Eulerian models concern about the change of properties (e.g. temperature, land cover) at fixed locations, while Lagrangian models tracks the movement of objects in space.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs said, one more important distinction is that geographic information systems (GISs) are composed of raster and vector data.[^intro-4]\n\n[^intro-4]: [Spatial data models](https://planet.uwc.ac.za/nisl/gis/web_page/page_15.htm)\n\n```{r}\n#| label: intro1\n#| echo: false\n#| fig.align: 'center'\n#| fig.cap: \"Credits:[Spatial data models](https://planet.uwc.ac.za/nisl/gis/web_page/page_15.htm)\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/layers.jpg\")\n```\n\nIn this workshop only vector data will be examined to provide insight into geographic variations in distribution of data (such as species, frogs in Oregon and/or diseases risk spread).[^intro-5]\n\n[^intro-5]: [Vector data models](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_essentials-of-geographic-information-systems/s08-data-models-for-gis.html)\n\n> In vector data models space is not quantized into discrete grid cells like the raster model, but use points and associated X, Y coordinate pairs to represent the vertices of spatial feature.\n\nIn particular, will be examined location clustering and disease clustering.\n\nWe will be looking at two case studies:\n\n-   Oregon frogs habitat locations\n-   Cancer expected development in a particular location\n\nSpatial models allows for spatial autocorrelation. In general modeling, multicollinearity, or correlation among predictors in the model is used to make predictor selection. In case of spatial modeling, predictors such as longitude and latitude are evidence of important underlying spatial processes at work; an integral component of the data. [^intro-6]\n\n[^intro-6]: https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/regression-analysis-basics.htm\n\nSpatial data is considered typically autocorrelated and/or clustered.[^intro-7] A simple explanation is concerning with the independence of correlated clusters with the changing data-information in the spatial cluster.\n\n[^intro-7]: [developing a cancer atlas](https://atlas.cancer.org.au/developing-a-cancer-atlas/Chapter_4.html)\n\nHence, data may be spatially correlated and observations in neighboring areas may be more similar than observations in areas that are farther away.[^intro-8]\n\n[^intro-8]: [Geospatial Health Data: Modeling and Visualization with R-INLA and Shiny](https://www.paulamoraga.com/book-geospatial/sec-arealdatatheory.html)\n\nThe analysis of the residual spatial autocorrelation and the prediction of continuous spatial process is called **Kriging**(geo interpolation named after Danie Kringe (South Africa)) (also known as *Wiener--Kolmogorov* prediction / distance-weighted average).[^intro-9]\n\n[^intro-9]: Drew CA, Wiersma Y, Huettmann F.

And https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging\n\nA spatial model is a representation of various social and natural processes:\n\n-   land cover change\n-   spread of invasive species\n-   population migration\n\nSo, to be more explicit, spatial modeling combines spatial analysis and predictions.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: intro-2\n#| echo: false\n#| fig.align: 'center'\n#| fig.cap: \"Credits:https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.13116\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/framework.png\")\n```\n\n**Krinking** is even the term that defines the best model performance, and so, the best prediction. This term is considered as synonym of *prediction* in classical data forecasting model techniques.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe integration of **GIS** and **Multicriteria Decision-Making Analysis (MCDA)** is key in providing help to decision makers in different areas.\n\nGIS-based MCDA use a linear weighted equation to combine the spatial variables.[^intro-10]\n\n[^intro-10]: [geospatial analysis and model building](https://gistbok.ucgis.org/bok-topics/geospatial-analysis-and-model-building)\n\n$$y=\\sum_{i=1}^n{w_if(x_i)}$$\n\nWhere $W$ defines a spatial neighborhood structure over the entire study region, and its elements can be viewed as weights.\n\nUnder this structure, the total number of neighbors in each area is adjusted to obtain a standardized matrix:\n\n$$w_\\text{std(i,j)}=\\frac{w_{ij}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}{w_{ij}}}$$\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"intro.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.189","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"intro.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
