Another option is to use {usethis} and some of its handling functions, for open the project in your machine.\n\nOnce set go to the `/data` folder and load the RData in the environment. It will make things easier as you don't need to run some chucks of code which will require some time to compute, and for this reason are set to `eval = FALSE`.\n\nFor any questions please email: docksbox@pm.me\n",
